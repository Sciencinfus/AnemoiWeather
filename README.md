# AnemoiWeather
This project is my final project assignment done in the frame of the 2022 S50's Introduction to Computer Science


Creating an entire project may seem daunting. Here are some questions that you should think about as you start:

My software enable its users to display general and detailed weather data related to a set of cities.

I have made the project alone without the help of others classmates.

## Technologies
Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON

The weather data comes from https://openweathermap.org/. The free of charge subscription enables access to
- World coverage more than 200.000 cities
- Update every 10 minutes
- 60 calls/minute and 1,000,000 calls/month which is more than enough for my project size
